# Breast Cancer Classification - with XAI

## Description
<!-- <span style="color:red;"></span> -->
&emsp; This is a Machine Learning Project that uses various Machine Learning Algorithms to classify that whether a cell with certain features and characteristics is benign or malignant.  
I have used many classification algorithm( Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms) like Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with Cross Validation, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier.

Also Explainable AI (XAI) - LIME is used to explain my model(which is blackbox model). The lime tabular explainer is used to show which features are used in the giving the prediction probalities.

***Best Accuracy was given by the Logistic Regression with Cross Validation***

## Future Plan 
&emsp; <!-- 4 tab spaces -->
I am planning to use Deep Learning to build neural network to predict cancer. Also I am planning to create a separate project for Detecing Breast cancer from UtraSound Image

## Dataset
&emsp; Dataset is present in slearn

use the command


    sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer
